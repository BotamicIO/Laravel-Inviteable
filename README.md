# Laravel Inviteable

I would appreciate you taking the time to look at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faustbrian) and considering to support me if I'm saving you some time with my work.

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-inviteable
```

And then include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

``` php

```

To get started, you'll need to publish the vendor assets and migrate:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BrianFaust\Inviteable\InviteableServiceProvider" && php artisan migrate
```
